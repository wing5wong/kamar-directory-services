# KAMAR Directory Service Example

## Initial Configuration
Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and set the values for:
- `KAMAR_DS_USERNAME` Your Directory Service Username
- `KAMAR_DS_PASSWORD` Your Directory Service Password
- `KAMAR_DS_FORMAT` Your Directory Service Format (json|xml)

__Do not set Username and Password values in the config file.__

Set the values in `/config/kamar.php` for:
- `serviceName` e.g. "Kamar Directory Service"
- `serviceVersion` e.g. 1.0
- `infoUrl` e.g. "https://www.myschool.co.nz/more-info"
- `privacyStatement` e.g. "Change this to a valid privacy statement | All your data belongs to us and will be kept in a top secret vault."
- `options` The options to be requested for your directory service

## Routes
A single route is defined in `/app/routes/kamar.php` accepting `POST` requests to `/kamar`.  
The route is handled by `/app/Http/Controllers/HandleKamarPost.php`.  
Base functionality as described in the KAMAR example is implemented here, but you are free to adjust to suit your requirements.

## Middleware
A new `kamar` middleware group is created in `/app/Http/Kernel.php`.  
The group is the same as the default `web` group, but has the csrf middleware removed.  
You MUST make sure you are authenticating requests to your application.  

## Storage
The example implementation will write json data files at `/storage/app/data`. These files are not publicly accessible by default.

## Commands & Schedules
A `RemoveOldDataFiles` command is available that will remove files older than 3 days.
A schedule to run the command daily is also configured (`/app/Console/Kernel.php`)

Run the command manually with `php artisan KamarDS:removeOldDataFiles`, or configure a cron job to run the task as per the schedule.

For information on configuring a schedule, see https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/scheduling#running-the-scheduler

## Testing
Run tests with `php artisan test`
